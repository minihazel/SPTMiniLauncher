# SPT Launcher
An overhauled version of the original SPT Mini Launcher. This acts as both a launcher and a miniature mod management utility that mostly caters to experienced SPT-AKI users.

## Installing
* Download the tool from the <a href="https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1017-spt-mini-launcher/">AKI Workshop</a>.
* Extract the `SPT Launcher` folder to wherever you want it using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-Zip</a>.
* Open the folder and run `SPT Launcher.exe`

## Usage
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bx9D9cgi4k">video demonstration</a> covers a pretty thorough but brief showcase of how you use the tool.

Right-Clicking `Open server mods` and `Open client mods` will cycle to `Open server modlist` and `Open client modlist` respectively.

When either of the two are displaying `modlist` instead of `mods` you can open the mod mod manager window by Left-Clicking them.
