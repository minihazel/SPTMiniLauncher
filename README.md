# SPTMiniLauncher
A remade version of the original SPT Mini Launcher. This acts as both a launcher and a miniature mod management utility that mostly caters to experienced SPT-AKI users.

## Features
This feature-set is incomplete as I have some more plans for this later down the road!

- Launch and stop both the Aki Server and Launcher and Tarkov itself
- Cache clearing on launch and stop
- Shortcuts to both mods folder (BepInEx/plugins, user/mods)
- Small-scale mod management for adding or removing mods
- Compatibility for popular mods / tools (such as SPT-AKI Profile Editor)

## Installing
* Download the tool from the <a href="https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1017-spt-mini-launcher/">AKI Mods Workshop</a>.
* Extract the `SPT Launcher` folder to wherever you want it using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-Zip</a>.
* Open the folder and run `SPT Launcher.exe`

## Usage
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bx9D9cgi4k">video demonstration</a> covers a pretty thorough but brief showcase of how you use the tool.

Right-Clicking `Open server mods` and `Open client mods` will cycle to `Open server modlist` and `Open client modlist` respectively.

When either of the two are displaying `modlist` instead of `mods` you can open the mod mod manager window by Left-Clicking them.
